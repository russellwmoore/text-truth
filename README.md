# Text ? Truth


This project is the result of a 4 day solo hackathon while a student at Fullstack Academy of Code. Although the code is a bit thrown together, I'm ultimately satisfied with how it turned out. 

`npm install` then `npm run start-dev` to build

## Quick Summary of my inspiration: 

After implementing IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer API to analyze text and visualize the results, I noticed that the results didn't quite line up with my expectations for data sets of every size. Determined to rationalize Watson's return values, I implemented a small text analysis and comparison tool to try an make sense of it all.
